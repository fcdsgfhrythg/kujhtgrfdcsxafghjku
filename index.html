  <h3>The earth is wide</h3>

  <p>Many people are under the false belief that the earth is a sphere, or flat, or a donut, or a giant cat. However, the truth is far more complex: The earth is wide.</p>

  <h2>Why is the earth wide?</h2>

  <p>There are many reasons why the earth is wide. </p>

  <ol>
    <li>The moon</li>
    <li>Similar wide planets</li>
    <li>NASA launch locations</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Firstly, everyone knows that gravity exists. The earth's gravity is the only thing that is keeping you from flying into space. It is also what makes the earth a sphere. However, the moon also has a gravity, and due to the small distance between the earth and the moon, the moon's gravitational forces also act on the earth. This is what creates tides; the gravity of the moon is moving the water.

    A much more serious effect of this gravity comes in the form of affecting the shape of the earth. The gravity not only pulls the water, but also the land, and the land under water, causing it to deform. Because the moon does not fly over the poles of the earth, over time the surface around the equator gets more stretched, creating a wider earth.
  </p>

  <p>This is supported by similarly wide planets found both inside and outside our solar system. For instance, take Saturn. The so-called "rings" are just a wide extrusion near the equator. Becuase Saturn has 146 moons, the enwidening effect of the moons is much more noticable. This is also present in the planets uranus and neptune.</p>

  <p>There is also evidence that governments and organizations such as NASA are aware of this property. Have you noticed that NASA likes to launch its rockets near the equator? That is because the wider earth means that the equator is closer to space than the poles, making it less costly to go to space.</p>
